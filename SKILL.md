# Power Analysis Lens

Framework for analyzing hidden power dynamics in organizations, relationships, and events. Based on Robert Caro's approach to understanding power through biography.

---

## When to Use

- Need to understand who's really in charge
- Official org charts don't match reality
- Decisions seem inexplicable without hidden context
- Analyzing organizational politics or dysfunction
- Writing about institutions, politics, or history

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "I don't understand the politics"
- "Who's really in charge here?"
- "What's the power dynamic?"
- "Why did this decision get made?"
- "This doesn't make sense on the surface"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | The organization, event, or relationship to analyze |
| visible_structure | No | Official hierarchy, org chart, stated authority |
| puzzling_decisions | No | Outcomes that don't match stated goals |
| key_players | No | People involved |

---

## Core Principle

> "What I'm interested in is power. How does it work? What are the mechanisms?"
> — Robert Caro

> "I wanted to use biography as a means of examining political power."
> — Robert Caro

Power in textbooks comes from elections and titles. Real power operates differently. Robert Moses was never elected to anything—yet he held more power than mayors and governors for forty years. Understanding *how* is the key.

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Map the Official Structure

First, document what power is *supposed* to look like:

- [ ] Org chart / formal hierarchy
- [ ] Titles and official roles
- [ ] Decision-making processes on paper
- [ ] Budgets and resource allocation
- [ ] Reporting relationships

This is the map everyone sees. It's rarely the territory.

### Step 2: Ask the Core Power Questions

For each key player and situation:

| Question | What It Reveals |
|----------|-----------------|
| Who can say no? | Real veto power, not formal authority |
| Who controls money? | Budget power often exceeds title power |
| Who controls information? | Gatekeepers shape decisions |
| Who has access? | Physical/calendar access to decision-makers |
| Who survives? | The unchanged after leadership changes |
| Who do people fear? | Fear indicates real power |
| Who do people owe? | Favors create power networks |

### Step 3: Identify Power Mechanisms

Power has specific mechanisms. Look for:

**Control mechanisms:**
- Budget control (who approves spending?)
- Hiring/firing authority (who decides careers?)
- Information flow (who knows first? who controls release?)
- Meeting control (who sets agendas? who's in the room?)
- Physical space (who controls access, location, resources?)

**Relationship mechanisms:**
- Mentorship networks (who brought up whom?)
- Favor trading (who owes whom?)
- Alliance structures (who votes together?)
- Fear relationships (who intimidates whom?)
- Social access (who talks outside work?)

**Robert Moses's mechanisms:**
- Public authorities with independent revenue
- Bond covenants that outlasted governors
- Control of parks, bridges, highways—physical infrastructure
- Relationships with bankers, unions, newspapers
- Decades of favor-trading

### Step 4: Follow the Money

Power often follows money more than titles.

- Who controls budgets?
- Who can commit resources without approval?
- Who has revenue streams independent of oversight?
- Who decides compensation?
- Who has financial relationships outside the organization?

### Step 5: Trace the Decisions

Take a specific decision that seemed surprising. Work backward:

1. What was the stated reason?
2. Who benefited from this decision?
3. Who was harmed or passed over?
4. Who advocated for it privately?
5. What wasn't considered that should have been?
6. What was the real reason?

### Step 6: Look for the Powerless

> "What I am trying to do is to show not only how power works but the effect of power on the powerless."
> — Robert Caro

The Cross-Bronx Expressway displaced 170,000 people. Understanding power means understanding who it harms:

- Who can't refuse?
- Who wasn't consulted?
- Who bears costs without benefits?
- Whose voice is absent from the room?

## Power Archetypes to Look For

| Archetype | How to Identify |
|-----------|-----------------|
| The Gatekeeper | Controls access to decision-makers |
| The Fixer | Gets things done outside official channels |
| The Survivor | Outlasts multiple regimes |
| The True Believer | Ideological, may have moral authority |
| The Connector | Maintains relationships across silos |
| The Patron | Promotes protégés, builds loyalty network |
| The Quiet Power | Titles don't match influence |
| The Facade | Big title, little actual power |

---

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Power map | Who really controls what |
| Mechanism analysis | How power actually operates |
| Decision trace | Why things happened the way they did |
| Vulnerability analysis | Who has power over whom |
| Powerless impact | Who bears costs of power |

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**User:** "I'm writing about a nonprofit that suddenly fired their popular CEO. The board says 'strategic differences' but that doesn't explain it. What's really happening?"

**Power Analysis response:**

"Strategic differences" is never the real answer. Let's find the mechanism.

**Start with the power questions:**

1. **Who initiated this?** Which board member(s) wanted her out? Board votes are rarely unanimous in sentiment even when unanimous in outcome. Find the originator.

2. **What changed?** A popular CEO doesn't get fired without a trigger. Options:
   - She threatened someone's power (went around someone, took credit)
   - She discovered something (financial irregularity, conflict of interest)
   - External pressure (major donor, government, press)
   - Power shift on the board (new member with different allegiance)

3. **Follow the money:**
   - Who are the major donors?
   - Did relationships with any of them change?
   - Are there financial interests that conflicted with her leadership?
   - Who controls the budget now?

4. **Who benefits from her removal?**
   - Who becomes acting/interim leader?
   - Who gains influence they didn't have before?
   - Are there programs or directions that can now change?

5. **The stated reason vs. the mechanism:**
   - "Strategic differences" means conflict over direction
   - But why did *she* lose that conflict?
   - Who has the votes and why?

**What to research:**

- Board composition changes in the last 2 years
- Major donations or grants in the last year
- Any programmatic changes that were controversial
- Who has been quiet (the quiet ones often hold power)
- Interview the people who left recently

**The likely mechanisms:**
1. A powerful board member felt threatened or bypassed
2. A major donor made demands she wouldn't meet
3. Financial irregularity she discovered (or is being blamed for)
4. Ideological shift on the board that accumulated votes

The popular CEO loses when popularity isn't where the power lives. The power lives in votes, money, and relationships. Which one did she lose?

## Integration

This skill pairs with:
- **turn-every-page-research** - Documents reveal power mechanisms
- **silence-interview-technique** - Interviews reveal hidden dynamics
- **scene-over-summary** - Show power in action, not abstraction

---

## Constraints

- Analysis, not investigation—can't access internal documents
- Speculation must be labeled as such
- Ethical considerations when analyzing living people
- Power analysis is not the same as moral judgment
